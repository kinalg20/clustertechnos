                    <div class="para"> The automotive industry is driven by high levels of innovation and
                        flexibility. As per a survey conducted in 2010, approximately 4% of the United States' GDP was
                        accounted by the automotive sales. Since 2011, the sales have increased by 11% and are expected
                        to grow at a steady rate. Technological advancements have empowered the industry to reduce
                        operational costs, enhance quality and productivity, streamline compliance and develop
                        end-to-end automotive solutions. Utilizing customized software product, organizations can
                        improvise supply chain collaboration, accelerate innovation and diversify product offerings to
                        increase the ROI for their business. </div>
                    <h3> Challenges and Opportunities </h3>
                    <div class="para"><strong>Dependency on Traditional Tools:</strong>
                        Automotive processes are driven by hardware. Traditional integrations and tools hinder
                        the collaboration process, resulting in surging costs and increased time to market the product.
                        Organizations in the automotive industry are conducting 90% of the product changes utilizing
                        targeted software. This amplifies the velocity and volume of the engineering change almost by 10
                        to 100 times in comparison with hardware.
                    </div>
                    <p class="para"><strong>Regulation Compliance:</strong> Safety and environmental regulations such as
                        ISO 26262 and Automotive SPICE are imposed by government agencies to enhance the process and
                        product quality. For businesses, ineffective management of resources can result in soaring
                        expenses and extended time to market the deliverables. </p>
                    <p class="para"><strong>Comprehending Isolated Groups:</strong> Isolated systems and groups in the
                        global automotive ecosystem can be tedious to comprehend. Consequently, decision making based on
                        incomplete and out dated data can make the entire process error prone and time consuming. The
                        adversely impacts the quality and can drop the level of productivity. </p>
                    <p class="para"><strong>Competition:</strong> The automotive industry is expanding its reach across
                        boundaries and this has resulted in cut-throat competition in the marketplace. Furthermore,
                        regulatory and consumer pressure to render sophisticated and high quality products lead to
                        soaring expenses and unsustainable time-to-market. </p>
